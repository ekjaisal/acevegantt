*acevegantt.* is a free, open-source, full-stack Gantt chart implementation tailored for academic event management. It provides a simple admin console for managing users and adding or editing tasks rendered to authenticated users on the frontend interface as a Gantt chart. While *acevegantt.* is custom-built for internal tracking of academic conferences, workshops, etc., it is adaptable with minor modifications for other event formats and use cases.

## Requirements üìã

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Firebase BaaS (available with Google account)

## Usage üíª

1. Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/ekjaisal/acevegantt/releases) page and extract the zip file (recommended approach). Alternatively, clone the repository using the `git clone https://github.com/ekjaisal/acevegantt.git` command.

2. Navigate to the <u>acevegantt</u> directory and install all the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.

3. Set up the database from **[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) ‚Üí Create a Project ‚Üí  Build ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí Create Database**.

4. Generate a new private key for the service account from **Project Overview ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Service Accounts ‚Üí Generate New Private Key** and save the downloaded file as <u>serviceAccountKey.json</u> in the <u>backend</u> sub-directory within the <u>acevegantt</u> directory.

   ***Note:** Do not upload the <u>serviceAccountKey.json</u> file to a public repository.*

5. Configure the environment variables in the <u>.env</u> file in the root directory by replacing `your-project-id` with the Firebase Project ID and `your-jwt-secret` with a secret string for JWT encryption.

   ***Note:** Do not upload the <u>.env</u> file to a public repository.*

6. To create an initial admin user, modify the <u>create-admin.js</u> file in the root directory by replacing the `set_admin_user` and `set_admin_password` with the preferred admin username and password and run `node create-admin.js` command.

7. Modify the `Event Placeholder` in <u>index.html</u> with the actual event name to be displayed in the chart interface.

8. Run `node server.js` to start the local server. Access the chart interface from [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and the admin console from [http://localhost:5000/admin](http://localhost:5000/admin).

9. To thoroughly test the implementation and to see the live preview of modifications, run the local sever using  `nodemon server.js` instead of `node server.js`.

## Deployment üöÄ

1. Choose a hosting platform for deployment based on the project requirements (a generous, permissive free tier for smaller projects or a paid tier for larger projects).
2. Set up the environment variables from the <u>.env</u> file and any others as the hosting platform requires.
3. Deploy the code following the hosting platform's guidelines.
